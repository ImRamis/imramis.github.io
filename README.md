# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Ramis

**OSCP | MSc Cybersecurity & AI | Full-Stack Engineer → Security | Penetration Testing | Secure Systems | DevSecOps**

I’m a full-stack software engineer with 5+ years of backend, infrastructure, and cloud development experience, now specializing in **cybersecurity and secure software engineering**.

Currently pursuing an MSc in **Cybersecurity & Artificial Intelligence** at *The University of Sheffield* (Russell Group), I hold the **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** certification, and am preparing for the **CREST CRT**. I’m particularly interested in application security, web exploitation, DevSecOps pipelines, and cryptographic engineering.
